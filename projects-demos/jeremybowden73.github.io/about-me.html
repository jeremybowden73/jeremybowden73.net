    <div class="aboutmeHeader">The Past</div>
    <p>In
      <a class="hyperlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop">the 1990s</a> I graduated with an Honours degree in Engineering. This led to gainful employment in the engineering
      sector, working with companies such as GE, Caterpillar, and Dunlop.</p>
    <div class="aboutmeLeftColumn">
      <p>I acquired some skills that helped me do my job...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expert 3D CAD/CAE skills</li>
        <li>Expert in PLM (Product Lifecycle Management; essentially GitHub for engineers and product designers)</li>
        <li>Great knowledge of Excel</li>
        <li>Great engineering knowledge, like knowing the endurance stress limit for most steels is roughly 50% of the tensile
          strength
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="aboutmeRightColumn">
      <p>And some that helped make me more valuable to my colleagues...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Presenting and describing my ideas</li>
        <li>Communicating with peers both informally and in formal reviews</li>
        <li>Making and implementing contingency plans, when things went a little bit wonky</li>
        <li>Adapting to established company cultures</li>
        <li>Helping others to develop skills when I had greater knowledge or experience</li>
        <li>Developing a good sense of when to relinquish and when to hold the line</li>

    <div class="aboutmeHeader">The Present</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>A 'zen' moment? The stars aligning? An epiphany? Call it what you will; the events of 2017 marked the beginning of my
      current journey into computer programming.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As a result of</p>
    <ul>
      <li>being made redundant, and</li>
      <li>a late night conversation with a friend</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I started to think seriously about a change of career, from engineering to computer programming. Since childhood I've
      had a 'background' interest in computers but I'd not really considered it as a career until the friend said it to me
      straight. We'd discussed which elements of engineering I enjoyed and had an aptitude for. Four words set me on the
      path that led me to where I am today:
      <em>&quot;You should do coding&quot;</em>.
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>I got a book from the library and raced through it, learning how to say &quot;Hello World&quot;, the difference between
        a char and a string, and how pointers work in C.</p>
      <p>I found myself consumed: by the sublime logic of the code; by the sense of accomplishment of creating something with
        a logical, specific purpose; by the refreshing, rewarding feeling of learning something new. And it all made sense!
        Well, maybe 99%.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So that's why today I call myself a Fledgling Programmer.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <hr class="hr2">
      <div class="aboutmeHeader">The Future</div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Short-term, my goal is to continue learning programming skills and languages by studying at my own pace with online
        e-learning providers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>But my eventual objective is to take my career into one of the many areas of &quot;computer programming&quot; that
        appeal to me. It's such a large field that I can't say, at the moment, exactly what I want to do. That's why I think
        it's important to focus my learning on programming
        <em>skills</em>, not just programming
        <em>languages</em>.</p>
